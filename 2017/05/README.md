# Day 5: A Maze of Twisty Trampolines, All Alike

https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/5

## Part One

I was going to write a program to print the jump table in a pretty format the same was as the example, but seeing the length of my input has discouraged me from doing so.

```
❯ perl jump.pl < example
5

❯ perl jump.pl < input
375042
```

## Part Two

A simple enough modification to the first part.

```
❯ perl jump.pl 2 < example
10

❯ perl jump.pl 2 < input
28707598
```
