## Part One

I don't think I care about the specific number, so long as every time it's multiple of 100, we consider the dial on zero.

```
❯ zsh pass.zsh < example1
  50 L68 ->  -18
 -18 L30 ->  -48
 -48 R48 ->    0
   0 L5  ->   -5
  -5 R60 ->   55
  55 L55 ->    0
   0 L1  ->   -1
  -1 L99 -> -100
-100 R14 ->  -86
 -86 L82 -> -168
