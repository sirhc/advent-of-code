# My Advent of Code Solutions

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

I started doing this in 2024, which means any of the solutions I commit from before that date were done retroactively.
While it looks like I did the first five days in 2018, I no longer have the code I used to solve those puzzles. It's too
bad I haven't been doing it, because it would have been fun to see how my approach to programming has changed over time.
