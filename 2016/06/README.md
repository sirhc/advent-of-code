# Day 6: Signals and Noise

## Part One

This looks like I can reuse the code I wrote for the triangle solution in
[part two of day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/3#part2) and the letter frequency solution from
[day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/4).

```
❯ perl message.pl example1
easter

❯ perl message.pl input
qtbjqiuq
```

I thought I had gotten something wrong, since I've seen edge cases that appear in the input but not in the example. But
my code was sound and I submitted my solution anyway. Turns out it was correct. Which means part two should be
interesting.

## Part Two
