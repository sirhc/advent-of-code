# Day 15: Timing is Everything

## Part One

All right, this isn't terribly difficult. We just need to increment the starting time until we can determine when every disc will be at position 0 as the capsule reaches
it. The math is fairly straightforward.

```
❯ perl timing.pl < example | tail -3
time=5
time=6 disc1=0
time=7 disc2=0

❯ perl timing.pl < input | tail -7
time=400589
time=400590 disc1=0
time=400591 disc2=0
time=400592 disc3=0
time=400593 disc4=0
time=400594 disc5=0
time=400595 disc6=0
```

## Part Two
