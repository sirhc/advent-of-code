# Day 10: Balance Bots

https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/10

## Part One

I suppose there is some way to accomplish this by defining a graph, but it was fun to simulate.

```
❯ perl bots.pl input | grep '17 and 61'
Bot 56 is comparing 17 and 61
```

## Part Two

```
❯ perl bots.pl input | tail -1
{ output0 => [7], output1 => [59], output2 => [19] }
```
