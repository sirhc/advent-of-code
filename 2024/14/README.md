## Part One

This problem is suspiciously straight forward. I didn't even need to do any simulation. The position of each robot at
time `t` is a simple calculation. What's the catch?

```
❯ perl robots.pl 101 103 100 input | tail -4
{
    quadrants     => { 1 => 118, 2 => 128, 3 => 110, 4 => 133 },
    safety_factor => 220971520,
}
```

## Part Two
